                    <p class="item item5">During X-ray examinations of a patient with a broken bone, head injury, or other health issues, A.I. could help find the source of the injury or the source of the pain or health issue. When A.I. could analyze an x-ray find the problem and come up with a plan to heal the person or a treatment plan if the injury or health issue is more long-term (IBM Education, 2023). This ability to come up with a treatment plan or care plan can provide many advancements and options and eliminate possible mistakes. A.I. could help eliminate human error in reading an x-ray because if it knows what to look for it will not get distracted. This inability to get distracted can help remove human error because it will look specifically for the problem. As well, if it knows the specific symptoms it can narrow down what the problem could be. If it narrows down the problem it can remove the possibility of a doctor giving the incorrect diagnosis because the injury looks like something similar and not exactly what it is. A.I. can also assist in centralizing electronic health records. For example, after an x-ray is taken A.I. could be linked to a central database and put the x-ray with the diagnoses into these health records(Open AIâ€™s ChatGPT, 2021).</p>
                <h3 class="item item14">Health Records</h3>
                    <p class="item item15">This ability to centralize data and collect data in one location could become incredibly helpful when a doctor looks at someone's health History. As well, the AI could look at previous health records and compare them to similar records to make assumptions about diseases or sicknesses that a person could get based on their Previous health records. AI has many abilities and its ability to assist with health records could come in handy today, and in the future.</p>
