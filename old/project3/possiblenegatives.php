                <p class="item item9">Although AI can help the Healthcare industry, there are ways that it could hurt. For example if a person were to give a generative AI a false article and the AI were to take it as truth that could hurt people. It could hurt by giving a person a false diagnosis. It would give this diagnosis because its database shows an article with a diagnosis that is incorrect. If this diagnosis was then given and medication was given to a sick person it could lead to unknown side effects or in a worse case scenario, death. This could be prevented by only allowing certain people to input medical articles with correct information. Although this scenario is unlikely it is not impossible, but if measures are put into place the likelihood of this happening is low and AI can help diagnose and treat people</p>
