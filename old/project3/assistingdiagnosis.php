                <p class="item item7">With A.I. innovating rapidly it can make diagnoses more accessible and accurate for those who may not have access to doctors in close proximity. For example, a community living far away from a doctor's office or a hospital may have a hard time getting someone who is sick or injured to one of these locations, but with A.I. These communities may be able to get some help. If these communities have menial access to the internet they could use a generative AI, like GPT to get a diagnosis. With this access to AI the community would know if they could treat the illness or injury from their homes or if they needed to get them to a hospital. As well, the A.I. can give accurate diagnoses that will make the decision a lot easier so a community will not be guessing. This ability for generative A.I. to give an accurate diagnosis limits the ability for human error to cause unnecessary harm or injury to a person(WEF, 2023). As well, in communities with good access to healthcare professionals may not need AI to help them decide whether or not to take a person to a hospital, communities with access could still benefit. They could benefit from a Generative AI not suffering from human error. While doctors have gone through years of training they can still make mistakes which can cost some people there lives. If AI was used in a hard diagnoses it could help eliminate human error giving the wrong diagnosis and causing someone to die. Alternatively, if given symptoms the AI could help a doctor differentiate between multiple different diagnoses. This AI helping to differentiate between multiple different diagnoses can cause a doctor to give the correct diagnosis and save a person's life(Open AIâ€™s ChatGPT, 2021). Generative AI is still a fledgling but is innovating quickly and could begin to help doctors make a correct diagnosis.</p>
