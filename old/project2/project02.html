            <h2 class="item item2">Could AI Help?</h2>
                <p class="item item3">Artificial Intelligence, Also known as A.I. has made recent leaps and bounds in its ability to do tasks in the last 10 years. Some of the most well known A.I. that use language models are ChatGPT and Bing-AI. These Artificial intelligence language models use information gathered from other users and from information that has already been input into its system. This information it has access to can be helpful or harmful to people depending on the usage of the A.I. It can be helpful specifically in the field of healthcare where a database of healthcare information and symptoms could be compiled to help doctors or nurses with diagnoses. It could also be harmful by giving a doctor or a family member incorrect information and diagnosis which could result in the death of a person. With its massive increases in usability, A.I. will have a profound benefit to the Healthcare industry. It will help by assisting with diagnoses and treatments as well as helping with coming up with new solutions to provide care.</p>
               
            <h2 class="item item4">X-ray's and Health Records</h2>
                <h3 class="item item13">X-Ray's</h3>
                    <p class="item item5">During X-ray examinations of a patient with a broken bone, head injury, or other health issues, A.I. could help find the source of the injury or the source of the pain or health issue. When A.I. could analyze an x-ray find the problem and come up with a plan to heal the person or a treatment plan if the injury or health issue is more long-term (IBM Education, 2023). This ability to come up with a treatment plan or care plan can provide many advancements and options and eliminate possible mistakes. A.I. could help eliminate human error in reading an x-ray because if it knows what to look for it will not get distracted. This inability to get distracted can help remove human error because it will look specifically for the problem. As well, if it knows the specific symptoms it can narrow down what the problem could be. If it narrows down the problem it can remove the possibility of a doctor giving the incorrect diagnosis because the injury looks like something similar and not exactly what it is. A.I. can also assist in centralizing electronic health records. For example, after an x-ray is taken A.I. could be linked to a central database and put the x-ray with the diagnoses into these health records(Open AI’s ChatGPT, 2021).</p>
                <h3 class="item item14">Health Records</h3>
                    <p class="item item15">This ability to centralize data and collect data in one location could become incredibly helpful when a doctor looks at someone's health History. As well, the AI could look at previous health records and compare them to similar records to make assumptions about diseases or sicknesses that a person could get based on their Previous health records. AI has many abilities and its ability to assist with health records could come in handy today, and in the future.</p>
            <h2 class="item item6">Assisting in Diagnoses</h2>
                <img src="images/doctordiagnosing.jpg" alt="Doctor Diagnosing Image" class="image">
                <p class="item item7">With A.I. innovating rapidly it can make diagnoses more accessible and accurate for those who may not have access to doctors in close proximity. For example, a community living far away from a doctor's office or a hospital may have a hard time getting someone who is sick or injured to one of these locations, but with A.I. These communities may be able to get some help. If these communities have menial access to the internet they could use a generative AI, like GPT to get a diagnosis. With this access to AI the community would know if they could treat the illness or injury from their homes or if they needed to get them to a hospital. As well, the A.I. can give accurate diagnoses that will make the decision a lot easier so a community will not be guessing. This ability for generative A.I. to give an accurate diagnosis limits the ability for human error to cause unnecessary harm or injury to a person(WEF, 2023). As well, in communities with good access to healthcare professionals may not need AI to help them decide whether or not to take a person to a hospital, communities with access could still benefit. They could benefit from a Generative AI not suffering from human error. While doctors have gone through years of training they can still make mistakes which can cost some people there lives. If AI was used in a hard diagnoses it could help eliminate human error giving the wrong diagnosis and causing someone to die. Alternatively, if given symptoms the AI could help a doctor differentiate between multiple different diagnoses. This AI helping to differentiate between multiple different diagnoses can cause a doctor to give the correct diagnosis and save a person's life(Open AI’s ChatGPT, 2021). Generative AI is still a fledgling but is innovating quickly and could begin to help doctors make a correct diagnosis.</p>
            <h2 class="item item8">Downsides and Possible Negatives</h2>
                <p class="item item9">Although AI can help the Healthcare industry, there are ways that it could hurt. For example if a person were to give a generative AI a false article and the AI were to take it as truth that could hurt people. It could hurt by giving a person a false diagnosis. It would give this diagnosis because its database shows an article with a diagnosis that is incorrect. If this diagnosis was then given and medication was given to a sick person it could lead to unknown side effects or in a worse case scenario, death. This could be prevented by only allowing certain people to input medical articles with correct information. Although this scenario is unlikely it is not impossible, but if measures are put into place the likelihood of this happening is low and AI can help diagnose and treat people</p>
            <h2 class="item item10">AI's Future in the Healthcare Industry</h2>
                <p class="item item11">Although AI and Generative AI are still quite new they are innovating rapidly. With this rapid innovation AI and its abilities are increasing and should soon be able to help in the healthcare Industry to heal people who have been injured and make sick people feel better. Ai, and Generative AI can help the Healthcare Industry by assisting in diagnoses and reading an X-Ray, as well, they can assist in compiling Health Records and predicting the likelihood of a person getting a Disease. Overall, AI has made profound innovations for the better and if it begins to be used by Healthcare Industries it could help people live longer</p>
